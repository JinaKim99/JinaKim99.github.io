Hi!👋🏻 I am a Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Culture Technology <a href='https://ct.kaist.ac.kr/'>(GSCT)</a> at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am working at Human-Centered Interactive Technologies Lab <a href='https://hcitech.org/index.html'>(HCI Tech Lab)</a>, advised by Professor <a href='https://sanghoy.com/'>Sang Ho Yoon</a>.  

My research interests are Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), interaction sensing techniques for AR/VR, and accessibility utilizing the machine learning approach. I am always open to free chat about any interesting ideas!

[T2IRay: Design of Thumb-to-Index based Indirect Pointing for Continuous and Robust AR/VR Input](https://t2iray.hcitech.org/static/pdfs/T2IRay.pdf)

[**Project**](https://t2iray.hcitech.org/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- T2IRay is an indirect, free-hand fine-motor pointing framework based on thumb-to-index (T2I) motion. Our study
empirically provides system design guidance for effective interaction by focusing on two key aspects: ensuring precise
control and maintaining stable ray.
